                        From the moment you find out you're growing a little person, your
                        life will change in more ways than you can imagine. Maternity
                        shoots can be as formal or informal as you'd like. These shoots
                        can be done in my home studio or in an agreed outdoor location.
                        The best time to do your maternity shoot is in the few weeks
                        following the start of your third trimester.

                        Babies grow so fast and it is wonderful to capture the first few
                        days of their life and be able to keep those precious moments
                        always. The best time to capture your little one is between 5 and
                        14 days old.

                        Babies grow so fast and reach so many amazing milestones so
                        quickly and capturing them makes them so much more special. These
                        sessions are for babies who can sit unaided but are not yet
                        walking or crawling. I aim to capture their ever-growing
                        personality and beautiful smile while they're growing into a
                        little independent person.
